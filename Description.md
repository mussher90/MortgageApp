#Project Description
A react app that calculates mortgage repayments over the life of a loan given a loan amount, interest rate and term.

Results should be displayed as a bar chart with yearly interest and principle repayments.

THe project should include a utilities.ts file that includes the calculations and a chart.ts file for the chart component.

The loan amount should allow for accuracy to the nearest dollar.

It should also include a field to display the monthly repayment amount.

#Additional Features
Add a option to pay up to 20% extra each month that will go directly to principle.

Add the option for an offset account (example https://www.westpac.co.nz/home-loans-mortgages/options/choices-offset-floating/).  The offset account should display like another loan with amount and term and rate but with an additional field with the amount offset.  The repayments on the offset account should be added to the repayments on the main loan to calculate total repayments.

Use both of these features to display how much sooner you can pay off your mortgage.
